To solve this equation, we need to find the value of x. We can do this by taking the logarithm of both sides of the equation. The logarithm of 10^x is equal to the logarithm of 123.2, which is 2.2. So, we have 2.2=10^x. Now, we can take the logarithm of both sides of the equation again, this time with base 10. This gives us x=2.2. So, the value of x is 2.2.
